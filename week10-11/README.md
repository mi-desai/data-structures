Note: I've done a lot of background work on the AA Map app to try to get the lat/longs of the addresses into a geoJSON format, which in Leaflet allows for some great styling options that I'd like to incorporate. 

However, the tile layer from Mapbox is not loading for some reason. If you open the inspector on the page, you can see all the data I've piped in from the RDS. The other apps are just rendering their queries as text on a blank page, so those are easier to see.
